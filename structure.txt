An example of unstructured text that could be valuable for reporting is a list of the current members of Congress (https://www.congress.gov/members).  This is useful for reporters who are covering politics or congressional hearings.  The data could be presented by making a table that lists each memberâ€™s name, political party, state, committees, length of service, and when they were elected.
